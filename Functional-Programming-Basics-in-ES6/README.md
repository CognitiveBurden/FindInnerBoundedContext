With all the hubbub over functional programming in JavaScript land, it might be confusing what it’s all about. Functional programming can solve many problems more elegantly than imperative programming. In this presentation, explore functional programming’s mathematical roots and then learn to use ES6 (JavaScript) to dive into important concepts such as recursion, immutability, and currying. Functional programming will show itself to be an important tool in the programmer’s bag for enforcing modularity and readability, making code more understandable and easier to test.
