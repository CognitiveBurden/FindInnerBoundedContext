Making life a bit easier for mobile app developers through better REST API Design
-----------------------------------------------

Talk Overview:
---------------
As mobile app developers, more often than not, our apps interface with web services backend through a published RESTful interface. REST provides a convenient, lightweight and stateless way for clients to consume such services. However many services continue to expose APIs that were designed for the pre-smartphone era. This has proven to be a nightmare for mobile app developers who have to now figure out ways to retrofit an API that just does not work for them. This talk provides an overview of the guiding principles behind a RESTful Interface, focusing on aspects that are critical for mobile environments. It explores the specific limitations and requirements of mobile environments and how to define an API that will adapt to such environments. We also explore some tips that mobile app developers can adopt while dealing with archaic APIs. Whether you are a mobile app developer or a server side developer, this talk is for you. The best APIs are the ones that are designed factoring in input from the entire team!
