# Whirlwind tour through the HTTP2 spec

The HTTP protocol has come a long way since its first version HTTP V0.9 in 1991 and with the final release of the HTTP2 spec at the beginning of 2015 a whole next chapter of web development is ahead of us! After a quick tour through the protocol history, we will mine the gems from in HTTP/2 spec and see why this is an awesome step for a modern web. What can you already use today? And why today's best practices are tomorrow's antipatterns?
