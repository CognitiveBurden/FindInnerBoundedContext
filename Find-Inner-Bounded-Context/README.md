# Title
Finding Your Inner Bounded Context
## Abstract
Arguably one of the greatest insights presented by Eric Evans in "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software" is the idea of Bounded Contexts. The ability to divide large models and teams into digestable units and formalize the relationship between Bounded Contexts allows for greatly simplified solutions. While the intent of a Bounded Context is easily understood, the identification and creation of a Bounded Context in a legacy system can be challenging. This talk is a case study of how to break up a large monolithic application covering many areas of an insurance provider into simpler Bounded Contexts.
